Mathematical Modeling, Estimation and Optimal Control in the Dynamic Control Process of COVID19 Transmission<br /><br />

Compartmental models are a very general modelling technique. They are often applied to the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases.
The population is assigned to compartments with labels â€“ for example, S, I, or R, (Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered). 
People may progress between compartments. The order of the labels usually shows the flow patterns between the compartments.<br /><br />

The SIR model is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivatives of this basic form. The model consists of three compartments:<br />
S: The number of susceptible individuals. When a susceptible and an infectious individual come into "infectious contact", the susceptible individual contracts the disease and transitions to the infectious compartment.<br />
I: The number of infectious individuals. These are individuals who have been infected and are capable of infecting susceptible individuals.<br />
R for the number of removed (and immune) or deceased individuals. These are individuals who have been infected and have either recovered from the disease and entered the removed compartment, or died. It is assumed that the number of deaths is negligible with respect to the total population. This compartment may also be called "recovered" or "resistant".
